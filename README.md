# socialmedia_bot
There are two programs in socialmedia_bot.
- LinkedIn Connector
- LinkedIn Crawler

LinkedIn Connector logs into a user's account and automatically connects with a list of people from a CSV file. The CSV file must contain the LinkedIn URLs of the list of people.

LinkedIn Crawler logs into a user's account, enters a specified query with selected filters, and scrapes relevant information from the query (name, description, position, company).
